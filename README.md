# **MKV to WebM Transcoder**

This script converts video files in **MKV** format to **WebM** format using `ffmpeg`. The process is automated for all MKV files in a specified folder.

## **Requirements**

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

FFmpeg must be properly installed and accessible from the terminal.

## **Installation**

1. **Download and configure FFmpeg**:

   Ensure that **FFmpeg** is installed and its executable is accessible from the terminal or command prompt. If you don't have FFmpeg, you can download it from the official site and add it to your system `PATH`.

2. **Clone the repository or download the script**:

   If you have `git` installed, you can clone the repository using:

   git clone <repository-url>

   Alternatively, you can download the `.py` script to your local machine.

3. **Install dependencies**:

   This script only requires Python's standard libraries, so no additional dependencies are needed. However, if you want to set up a virtual environment, you can do so with:

   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file

## **Usage**

1. **Configure the folders**:
   
   - The script is set up to work with two local folders:
     - `carpeta_mkv`: The folder where the MKV video files are located (default: `C:/Users/NEAT-H1/Videos/CYGYC/mkv/`).
     - `carpeta_webm`: The folder where the converted WebM videos will be saved (default: `C:/Users/NEAT-H1/Videos/CYGYC/webm/`).
   
   Make sure these paths are correctly set in the script to point to the appropriate folders.

2. **Run the script**:

   To convert all MKV files in the input folder to WebM format, simply run the script with Python:

   python transponedor.py

   The script will scan the `carpeta_mkv` folder for `.mkv` files and convert them to **WebM** using `ffmpeg`. The converted files will be saved in the `carpeta_webm` folder.

## **How It Works**

1. The script scans the `carpeta_mkv` folder for files with the `.mkv` extension.
2. For each file found:
   - The file name is retrieved, and the title case is applied (to correct any uppercase/lowercase inconsistencies).
   - A `ffmpeg` command is created to convert the file to WebM.
   - The `ffmpeg` command is executed using `subprocess.run()`.
3. The script prints the executed command in the console along with any output or errors generated by `ffmpeg`.

## **Customization**

- You can change the paths for `carpeta_mkv` and `carpeta_webm` to any location you wish by modifying the variables at the beginning of the script.
  
- If you want to change the quality of the output videos, you can adjust the quality settings in the `ffmpeg` command. For example, you can tweak the video or audio quality using the `-q:v` and `-q:a` options.

## **Known Issues**

- Ensure that the output folder (`carpeta_webm`) exists before running the script, as `ffmpeg` will not create the folder automatically.
  
- If filenames contain special characters or spaces, `ffmpeg` may have trouble processing them. Ensure filenames are valid.
